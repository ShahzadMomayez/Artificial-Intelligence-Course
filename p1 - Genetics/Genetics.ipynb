    "Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points,possibly subject to constraints.In this case, A set of numbers are given. And you have to find the best function that fits on them. actually it is a kind of \"curve fitting problem\" and you have to find the coefficients of the fitted function.ِDetermine the coefficient of this polynomial expression. The goal is to determine the relationship between two independent (x) and dependent (y) based on the given points.The inputs of the problem are:coefficient range, degree of the wanted polynomial, the points that must be fitted on the polynomial.\n",

    "### summary of the work that has been done :\n",
    "- Step 1: Define the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by clearly defining the problem. You have a set of data points that you want to fit with a mathematical expression. Define the problem's constraints, including the type of functions you want to consider and any known parameter limits.\n",
    "- Step 2: Initialize the Population\n",
    "\n",
    "In a genetic algorithm, you begin by creating an initial population of potential solutions. Each solution in this context represents a possible mathematical expression.\n",
    "- Step 3: Evaluate Fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine a fitness function that quantifies how well each solution (mathematical expression) fits the given data points. A common measure is the sum of squared errors between the function's predictions and the actual data points.\n",
    "- Step 4: Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Use selection methods (e.g., roulette wheel or tournament selection) to choose solutions for the next generation. Solutions with higher fitness scores should have a higher chance of being selected.\n",
    "- Step 5: Crossover\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement crossover to create new solutions. In this step, two parent solutions are combined to create one or more offspring solutions. For mathematical expressions, this could involve exchanging parts of the expressions between parents.\n",
    "- Step 6: Mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply mutation to introduce small, random changes in the solutions. In the context of mathematical expressions, this could involve altering coefficients or introducing new terms.\n",
    "- Step 7: Termination Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Define termination criteria for your GA. This could be a maximum number of generations, a threshold fitness score, or other criteria.\n",
    "- Step 8: Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 3 to 6 for a predefined number of generations or until a termination condition is met.\n",
    "- Step 9: Best Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the GA terminates, the best solution in terms of fitness is the mathematical expression that fits the data points best.\n",
    "- Step 10: Post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tune the best expression if needed. You might need to round parameter values or simplify the expression.\n",

    "# Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. How can very large or very small population sizes affect the performance of the algorithm?\n",
    "#### very large population: \n",
    "- the algorithm may take a long time to find the best solution because of each iteration time\n",
    "- it may be unnecessary to spend that much time.\n",
    "- it also may have complex operations\n",
    "- each iteration would be longer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### very large population:\n",
    "- the diversity of the chromosomes is limited\n",
    "- we need more iteration to find a solution\n",
    "- total rum time would increase because of the more iteration\n",
    "- the algorithm may not be able to find the best solution because it may not have enough chromosomes to select from.\n",
    "\n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What happens if the population size increases in each generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### benefits:\n",
    " - The more the population size gets, the more accurate the result will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### disadvantages:\n",
    "- it increases the time complexity and the memory usage. \n",
    "- due to computation increment,speed would decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the effect of crossover and mutation? Is it possible to use only one of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- crossover: Crossover is used to create new chromosomes from the existing chromosomes. The problem of this operation is that; if we do not consider the chromosomes with special properties, we are not able to generate them and have such properties in our final result. so we should use mutation,too.\n",
    "- Mutation: Mutation is used to change the genes of the chromosomes. The problem of this method is that it does not have any relations with our primary population. for example, in this problem if we just do mutation, we can be far away from the efficient result.The reason is that we are changing the coefficients randomly and this is just random! we need to do crossover to use the primary population and lead to better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "so we should do both of them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. How to accelerate the algorithm?\n",
    "we should make the algorithm better by implementing crossover and mutation functions more efficiently.Fitness function, parameters such as the probability of crossover and mutation, and the population size should be chosen carefully. Also, the crossover and mutation functions can affect the performance of the algorithm.\n",
    " \n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. How to stop the algorithm if it is not converging?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we just use crossover operation, this happens. It indicates that it may have stopped at a local maximum instead of the global maximum. In order to avoid that, Mutation is a good choice. In mutation chromosomes are changed randomly and we can generate new properties. Also, we can limit the number of generations in order to stop the algorithm if it is not converging. In the other hand, multi-start is another way to increase the probability of finding the global maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. How to stop the algorithm if there exists no solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "we can put some limitations.\n",
    "* time limitation is a good one\n",
    "* also we can limit the iterations and set a specific amount of iterations.\n",
    "* Threshold fitness solution is another way.The algorithm will terminate after the threshold fitness solution has been attained.\n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. As the degree of polynomials increases, how does the time to find the coefficients change?\n",
    "The more the degree of the polynomial gets, the more the time complexity can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### reasons:\n",
    "1. Number of generations increases:in this case, more generations might be needed to reach an optimal or near-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Search space increases: in this case, the primary population will be increased and the \"list of list\" or \"data frame\" expands. this leads to an increase in the time required to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Risk of Overfitting Increases: polynomials with higher degrees are more complex in calculation and this leads to less probability of finding the best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complexity of Fitness Evaluation Increases:  As the degree of the polynomial increases, evaluating this fitness can become more computationally intensive, which can increase the time required per generation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<html><hr/></html>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. In your opinion, how does increasing or decreasing the number of points affect the implementation of the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The more the number of points gets, the more the time complexity can be. And also it enormously effects the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### increasing number of points:\n",
    "- some of our interations take longer time to be completed. and it increases the runtime.\n",
    "- Fewer data points can make the algorithm run faster\n",
    "\n",
    "###### decreasing number of points:\n",
    "in the other hand if the given points are less than enough, more than 1 answer is available. and we do not know which was is the wanted answer! in this case, increasing number of points, can potentially lead to more accurate and reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "it’s important to find a balance between the number of data points and the computational resources available.\n",
    "\n"
